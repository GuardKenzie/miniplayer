#### keybindings
This section allows you to change the keybinds for the player. The format for a keybind is `key = action` (for example `p = play_pause`). Available actions are
* `play_pause`
* `next_track`
* `last_track`
* `volume_down`
* `volume_up`
* `toggle_info`
* `help`
* `quit`


## Default keybinds

| Key | function      |
|-----|---------------|
| h   | Show keybinds |
| p   | Play/pause    |
| >   | Next track    |
| <   | Last track    |
| q   | Quit          |
| +   | Volume up     |
| -   | Volume down   |
| i   | Toggle info   |

These keybinds can be changed by editing the config file. See the [`config.example`](config.example) file for the format.

    
## F.A.Q.
1. **Q:** Album art is not showing up.  
**A:** Make sure your `music_directory` is not quoted i.e. if your music directory is `~/My Music` then your config should look like `music_directory = ~/My Music`.  
If this does not work, try changing `image_method` from `pixcat` to `ueberzug` or vice versa.

2. **Q:** Album art is too big/too small.  
**A:** You need to configure `font_height` and `font_width`. Their values should be the actual pixel height and width of a character in your terminal.
